 *
 * An implementation of a priority queue backed by a Fibonacci heap,
 * as described by Fredman and Tarjan.  Fibonacci heaps are interesting
 * theoretically because they have asymptotically good runtime guarantees
 * for many operations.  In particular, insert, peek, and decrease-key all
 * run in amortized O(1) time.  dequeueMin and delete each run in amortized
 * O(lg n) time.  This allows algorithms that rely heavily on decrease-key
 * to gain significant performance boosts.  For example, Dijkstra's algorithm
 * for single-source shortest paths can be shown to run in O(m + n lg n) using
 * a Fibonacci heap, compared to O(m lg n) using a standard binary or binomial
 * heap.
 *
 * Internally, a Fibonacci heap is represented as a circular, doubly-linked
 * list of trees obeying the min-heap property.  Each node stores pointers
 * to its parent (if any) and some arbitrary child.  Additionally, every
 * node stores its degree (the number of children it has) and whether it
 * is a "marked" node.  Finally, each Fibonacci heap stores a pointer to
 * the tree with the minimum value.
 *
 * To insert a node into a Fibonacci heap, a singleton tree is created and
 * merged into the rest of the trees.  The merge operation works by simply
 * splicing together the doubly-linked lists of the two trees, then updating
 * the min pointer to be the smaller of the minima of the two heaps.  Peeking
 * at the smallest element can therefore be accomplished by just looking at
 * the min element.  All of these operations complete in O(1) time.
 *
 * The tricky operations are dequeueMin and decreaseKey.  dequeueMin works
 * by removing the root of the tree containing the smallest element, then
 * merging its children with the topmost roots.  Then, the roots are scanned
 * and merged so that there is only one tree of each degree in the root list.
 * This works by maintaining a dynamic array of trees, each initially null,
 * pointing to the roots of trees of each dimension.  The list is then scanned
 * and this array is populated.  Whenever a conflict is discovered, the
 * appropriate trees are merged together until no more conflicts exist.  The
 * resulting trees are then put into the root list.  A clever analysis using
 * the potential method can be used to show that the amortized cost of this
 * operation is O(lg n), see "Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition" by
 * Cormen, Rivest, Leiserson, and Stein for more details.
 *
 * The other hard operation is decreaseKey, which works as follows.  First, we
 * update the key of the node to be the new value.  If this leaves the node
 * smaller than its parent, we're done.  Otherwise, we cut the node from its
 * parent, add it as a root, and then mark its parent.  If the parent was
 * already marked, we cut that node as well, recursively mark its parent,
 * and continue this process.  This can be shown to run in O(1) amortized time
 * using yet another clever potential function.  Finally, given this function,
 * we can implement delete by decreasing a key to -\infty, then calling
 * dequeueMin to extract it.
